		Welcome! Here is a list of things I think might be useful for our website:<br>
		<ul>
			<li>make panel backgrounds more translucent</li>
			<li>FIGURE OUT HOW TO GENERATE PAGES SO YOU HAVE INFORMATION ON WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, AS WELL AS THE OBJECT YOU'RE LOOKING THROUGH. so I want to look for like all assignments that are in ee 102a, how do i get both the data with the assignments as well as the fact that i'm looking for stuff in ee 102a? i'm totally at a loss with this. we need it for both course view (syllabus changing) as well as adding or modifying an assignment.</li>

			<li>when you click on a class, it brings you to the pie chart representing how you're doing and stuff. </li>
			<li>how do you add a grade? change settings? where on the page?</li>
			<li>for midterms have option next to assignment list to like add curve or something</li>
			<li>Adding things to a table eek</li>
			<li>generate navbar</li>
			<li>Fix the text on the navbar</li>
			<li>have clicking on the courses take you to the info page</li>
			<li>have a better way of adding classes and courses</li>
			<li>format the input of hte course. shouldn't have to input the title/prof if you don't want</li>
			<li>nav dropdown for all the courses you're in</li>
		</ul>
		<br><br>
		Icons to use:<br>
		<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></i> For delete<br>
		<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></i> For edit<br>
		<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-stats"></i> For viewing stats?</br>
		<i class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench"></i> For changing syllabus?</br>

		<br><br>
		Feature creep:
		<ul>
			<li>filter assignments by type</li>
			<li>customizable types of assignments (pset, lab, exam)</li>
			<li>count some assignments instead of others (without midterm, you're at...)</li>
		</ul>
